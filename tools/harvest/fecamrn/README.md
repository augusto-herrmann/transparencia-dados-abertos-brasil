# FECAMRN import scripts

These scripts import data from the FECAMRN data source. For more
information on the rationale and process, see the
[source description here](../../../sources/fecammrn/README.md).

## Usage

1. Create a Python virtual environment. This is not required, but it is
   recommended.
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python tools/harvest/fecamrn/fecammrn.py
   ```

Note: Python 3 is required for this script.
