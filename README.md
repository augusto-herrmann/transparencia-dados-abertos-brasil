## Transparency and Open Data Portals of Brazilian states and municipalities

This repository contains spreadsheets originally converted from tables 31 and
32 from [the PhD thesis of Rodrigo Klein
(2017)](http://tede2.pucrs.br/tede2/handle/tede/7724).

The objective is to collaborate on the monitoring of transparency of Brazilian
states and municipalities in projects such as
[Colaboradados](http://colaboradados.github.io/) and the [list of open data
catalogs in Brazil](https://github.com/dadosgovbr/catalogos-dados-brasil).

Where we notices a change in the portals' addresses (URLs) the tables have been
updated.
