The Interlegis Institute offers assistance to local parliaments in the
form of free and open source software solutions, hosting and other
services.

Among the free software offered, there is the *Portal Modelo* which can
be used to set up the municipal chambers' websites. It could therefore be
possible to obtain from Interlegis the list of websites that use *Portal
Modelo* and their respective URLs.

*Sistema de Informações Gerenciais do Interlegis* offers some information
on [a map](https://sigi.interlegis.leg.br/dashboard/mapa/), but the URLs
of the local parliaments are not there.

Information was obtained instead from an older version of
[a wiki page](https://colab.interlegis.leg.br/wiki/CasasUsamPortalModelo?version=414#L1).
However, the old wiki has currently been taken offline, replaced with a
notice that the old content's fate is uncertain.

Fortunately, the Web Archive has
[an old version of the page](https://web.archive.org/web/20190110071424/http://colab.interlegis.leg.br:80/wiki/CasasUsamPortalModelo)
that contains many links.
